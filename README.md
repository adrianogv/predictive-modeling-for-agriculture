# Soil Analysis for Optimal Crop Prediction

This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the optimal crop for a given field based on soil metrics such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium levels, and pH value. By leveraging data-driven insights, the project assists farmers in maximizing their crop yield while minimizing the need for expensive and time-consuming soil analyses.

## Project Overview

Farmers face critical decisions when selecting crops to plant, aiming to optimize yield by considering factors like soil condition. This project uses a dataset of soil measurements to train a multi-class classification model that predicts the best crop for a field. Additionally, the project identifies the single most important feature contributing to the model's predictive performance.

## Dataset

The dataset (`soil_measures.csv`) contains the following columns:

- **N**: Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- **P**: Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- **K**: Potassium content ratio in the soil
- **pH**: pH value of the soil
- **crop**: Target variable indicating the optimal crop for the field (categorical values)

Each row represents soil metrics for a specific field, along with the corresponding optimal crop.

## Objectives

1. Build multi-class classification models to predict the crop based on soil metrics.
2. Identify the single most important soil metric for predictive performance.
3. Provide actionable insights to farmers to assist in crop selection.

## Implementation

The project is implemented in Python and includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Handle missing values and normalize features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
   - Analyze class balance for the target variable.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Train multiple classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest).
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Use feature importance scores or permutation importance to identify the most critical feature.
5. **Model Deployment**:
   - Save the trained model for future use.

## Key Findings

- **Top Model Performance**: The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of *[0.2863636363636364]*.
- **Most Important Feature**: The feature *[K]* was identified as the most critical predictor for optimal crop selection.

## Future Work

Potential areas for further development include:

- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.
